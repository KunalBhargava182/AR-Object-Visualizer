# AR Object Visualizer: Android

An advanced Android app showcasing  **Augmented Reality (AR)** capabilities using **ARCore** and **Sceneform**. It enables users to render high-fidelity 3D models onto real-world surfaces, creating a seamless blend between the physical and digital environments.
##  Core Features

- üîÑ **Dynamic 3D Model Loading**  
  Loads `.glb` and `.gltf` models at runtime, supporting complex geometries and textures.

- üß≠ **Real-Time Plane Detection**  
  Accurately detects horizontal surfaces using ARCore for stable model placement.

- üëÜ **Interactive Placement System**  
  Users can place objects with a tap; ensures only one model is active at a time for a cleaner AR experience.

- üß© **Intuitive UI/UX**  
  Clean Material UI with a `RecyclerView` selector for browsing and choosing available 3D models.
